# Front-End Web OmniStack 9 - Rocketseat

This project was developed at rocketseat's OmniStack 9 week. The aim of this project is to develop a platform for programming companies to make their spaces available for developers to obtain new experiences. So they can get to know each other and exchange experiences.
